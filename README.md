# SurviveGA – Evolutionary Simulation Through Genetic Algorithms

SurviveGA is a research project developed as part of the **MSc Computer Games Technology** program at **Abertay University**, within the module **MAT501 – Applied Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence**.

## Project Description

**SurviveGA** is an evolutionary simulation platform designed to model the emergence of survival behaviours using **genetic algorithms** and **natural selection** principles.  
The system simulates a population of autonomous agents that must learn to navigate an environment containing beneficial resources, hazardous zones, and dangerous obstacles—without being explicitly programmed with survival strategies.

## Core Concept

SurviveGA examines how simple organisms can evolve increasingly sophisticated survival behaviours across generations through:

- **Selection pressure** from hazards and resource availability  
- **Genetic crossover** that combines successful traits from parents  
- **Random mutation** introducing behavioural diversity  
- **Elitism** preserving the most successful agents  

Agents do not receive direct instructions. Each agent carries a **genetic sequence** encoding its movement patterns. Agents that locate food and avoid danger achieve higher fitness scores, increasing their likelihood of passing on their traits.

## Evolutionary Mechanics

The simulation proceeds in generational cycles:

1. Agents perform behaviours determined by their DNA.  
2. Fitness scores accumulate based on environmental interactions.  
3. High-performing agents are selected as parents.  
4. Offspring inherit genetic material through **two-point crossover**.  
5. **Random mutations** introduce new behaviours and prevent local optima.  

Through repeated cycles, increasingly effective survival strategies emerge naturally.

## Research Applications

SurviveGA provides a controlled environment for studying:

- **Emergent behaviour** arising from simple rules and selective pressure  
- **Adaptive strategies** in multi-objective environments  
- **Population dynamics**, including exploration, exploitation, and convergence  
- **Evolutionary optimisation** of survival behaviours

The role of mutation rates in maintaining population diversity

This simulation provides insights into fundamental questions about evolution, learning, and adaptation—demonstrating how complexity can emerge from simplicity through iterative selection over time.
