## Project Description

SurviveGA implements genetic algorithms to train agents, referred to as *bunnies*, to survive in a hostile environment. The agents must explore, gather food, and avoid predators and poisoned food. The project investigates the effectiveness of genetic algorithms as an artificial intelligence approach within this context.

### Key Features
- Agents operate without vision or detection systems, learning purely through evolutionary fitness.  
- Parent selection mechanisms are applied to generate improved offspring.  
- Crossover functions are used to optimize agent behavior.  
- Mutation introduces variability, encouraging novel and unexpected solutions.  
- Fitness is calculated based on performance metrics such as survival and resource gathering.  

### Objectives
The objective of this project is to evaluate genetic algorithms as a viable AI method, analyzing their effectiveness and outcomes. The study also considers potential improvements to the implementation and explores whether alternative AI models may be better suited to this type of simulation.
